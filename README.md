# React Redux Isolate

Provides a way for multiple react-redux apps to share the same state tree, adhering to the principle of Single Source Of Truth,
without requiring changes to the apps. Inspired by [cyclejs/isolate](https://github.com/cyclejs/isolate).

* Isolate Redux reducers, allowing them to be mounted as a subtree inside a larger state tree.
* Isolate React components to sandbox their redux connection to the subtree.

### Installation

npm install --save react-redux-isolate
